## Overview

MashHub (also branded as MashFlow) is a comprehensive music library management system designed for DJs, music producers, and mashup creators. The system provides advanced song management, project organization, intelligent matching algorithms, and powerful search capabilities to help users organize and discover music for their creative projects.

## Core Features

### 1. Song Management

#### 1.1 Song Data Model
Each song in the system contains the following attributes:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (5-digit zero-padded string)
- **Title**: Song title
- **Artist**: Artist name
- **Type**: Song type/category
- **Origin**: Origin/source of the song
- **Year**: Release year
- **Season**: Season identifier
- **Notes**: Optional notes field for additional information

**Section-Based Architecture:**
Songs use a normalized section-based data model where musical properties (BPM, Key, Part) are stored at the section level:
- **Song Sections**: Each song can have multiple sections with:
  - **Section ID**: Unique identifier for the section
  - **Song ID**: Reference to the parent song
  - **Part**: Section name (e.g., "Intro", "Verse", "Chorus", "Bridge")
  - **BPM**: BPM value for this specific section
  - **Key**: Musical key for this specific section
  - **Section Order**: Sequential order of the section within the song (starting from 1)

- **Computed Properties** (derived from sections):
  - **BPMs**: Array of all unique BPM values from all sections
  - **Keys**: Array of all unique key values from all sections
  - **Primary BPM**: BPM from the first section (sectionOrder = 1)
  - **Primary Key**: Key from the first section (sectionOrder = 1)

#### 1.2 Song CRUD Operations

### 2. Project Management

#### 2.1 Project Structure
Projects are organizational containers for songs with the following features:
- **Project Properties**:
  - Unique ID (timestamp-based)
  - Name
  - Type: one of **Seasonal**, **Year-End**, **Song Megamix**, or **Other** (controls view and suggestion behavior)
  - Creation date
  - Sections (first-class organizational units with optional target BPM/key constraints)

- **Editing projects**: The **Settings** button in the project manager opens an **Edit project** modal where you can change the project **name** and **type**. Project-level year/season metadata is not in the data model and cannot be set.

#### 2.2 Section-Based Organization
- **Sections**: Projects contain first-class **project sections** (stored in IndexedDB).
  - Each section has: id, projectId, name, orderIndex.
  - Optional harmonic constraints (used for compatibility scoring when present):
    - **targetBpm**, **bpmRangeMin**, **bpmRangeMax**
    - **targetKey**, **keyRangeCamelot**, **keyRange** (array of keys)
  - **Section Settings dialog**: Edit section name and harmonic constraints (target BPM, BPM range min/max, target key, key range) via the section Settings control in the project workspace.

### 3. Advanced Search

#### 3.1 Fuzzy Search (Fuse.js Integration)

Fuzzy logic was applied to the search system using the Fuse.js library to enable intelligent, typo-tolerant searching across multiple song metadata fields. This implementation allows users to find songs even when their search queries contain spelling errors, partial matches, or variations of the actual data.

**How Fuzzy Logic Was Applied:**

1. **Library Selection**: Fuse.js was chosen as the fuzzy search engine because it provides:
   - Fast in-memory searching with pre-built indexes
   - Configurable similarity thresholds
   - Multi-field search with weighted scoring
   - Extended search syntax support
   - Match highlighting capabilities

2. **Fuzzy Matching Algorithm Configuration**:
   The system uses the following Fuse.js configuration parameters to control fuzzy matching behavior:
   - **Threshold (0.6)**: Controls how similar a match must be to be considered valid
     - Range: 0.0 (exact match) to 1.0 (match anything)
     - 0.6 means matches must be at least 60% similar to the query
     - Higher values = more lenient matching (finds more results, including typos)
     - Lower values = stricter matching (fewer results, closer to exact match)
   
   - **Distance (100)**: Maximum character distance allowed for a match
     - Limits how far apart matching characters can be in the text
     - Prevents matches that are too scattered
   
   - **MinMatchCharLength (2)**: Minimum number of characters that must match
     - Prevents single-character matches that would be too broad
     - Ensures meaningful search results
   
   - **IgnoreLocation (true)**: Matches can occur anywhere in the field
     - "anime" will match "Japanese Anime Music" even though "anime" appears in the middle
     - Improves search flexibility
   
   - **FindAllMatches (true)**: Finds all possible matches, not just the first
     - Ensures comprehensive search results
   
   - **UseExtendedSearch (true)**: Enables advanced query syntax
     - Supports field-specific searches (e.g., "title:anime artist:japan")
     - Allows quoted phrases and boolean operators

3. **Multi-field Weighted Search**:
   The fuzzy search algorithm searches across multiple song fields simultaneously, with each field assigned a weight that determines its importance in the final match score:
   - **Title (40% weight)**: Highest priority - song titles are most important for identification
   - **Artist (30% weight)**: Second priority - artist names are key identifiers
   - **Type (15% weight)**: Medium priority - song type/category matching
   - **Origin (10% weight)**: Lower priority - origin/source information
   - **Part (5% weight)**: Lowest priority - part identifiers are least critical
   
   The weighted scoring system ensures that:
   - A match in the title field contributes more to the final score than a match in the part field
   - Results are ranked by relevance, with the most relevant matches appearing first
   - Users can find songs even if they only remember partial information

4. **Fuzzy Matching Process**:
   When a user enters a search query:
   1. The query is passed to the Fuse.js search engine
   2. Fuse.js calculates similarity scores for each song across all weighted fields
   3. The algorithm uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm to measure string similarity
   4. Scores are combined using the field weights to produce a final relevance score
   5. Results are sorted by score (best matches first)
   6. Only results above the threshold (0.6) are returned
   7. Match locations are identified for highlighting in the UI

5. **Integration with Search Service**:
   The fuzzy search is implemented in the `SearchService` class (`src/services/searchService.ts`):
   - The service initializes a Fuse.js instance with the song database
   - The index is rebuilt whenever songs are added, updated, or removed
   - Search methods provide different levels of functionality:
     - `search()`: Basic fuzzy search with optional result limiting
     - `searchAdvanced()`: Combines fuzzy search with additional filters (vocal status, year range, BPM, key)
     - `searchExtended()`: Supports field-specific queries using extended syntax
     - `getSuggestions()`: Generates search suggestions based on fuzzy matches
     - `getSearchStats()`: Provides statistics about search results (total count, average score, categories)

6. **Real-time Search Experience**:
   The fuzzy search is integrated into the `AdvancedSearchBar` component to provide:
   - **As-you-type searching**: Results update in real-time as the user types
   - **Debounced input**: Prevents excessive searches while typing (improves performance)
   - **Search suggestions**: Shows potential matches before the user finishes typing
   - **Match highlighting**: Visual indicators show which parts of the text matched
   - **Score display**: Users can see how relevant each result is

7. **Benefits of Fuzzy Logic Application**:
   - **Typo tolerance**: Users can find songs even with spelling mistakes
   - **Partial matching**: Finds results with incomplete queries
   - **Flexible searching**: Works with variations in capitalization, spacing, and word order
   - **Relevance ranking**: Most relevant results appear first
   - **Multi-field intelligence**: Searches across all relevant metadata simultaneously
   - **User-friendly**: Reduces frustration from exact-match requirements

### 7. Database & Storage

#### 7.1 Dual-backend: Supabase + IndexedDB fallback

MashHub uses a **dual-backend** data layer so the app works with or without Supabase:

- **Primary (Supabase)**: When `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set and Supabase is reachable, all song and project data is stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL). Supabase Auth scopes projects to the signed-in user; optional Realtime can reflect project changes.
- **Fallback (IndexedDB / Dexie)**: If Supabase is unavailable at startup (no env, network error, or health check timeout) or fails mid-session, the app switches to IndexedDB. All CRUD goes through Dexie; CSV files can seed the local DB on first offline use.

**Health check and mode:**

- On app load, `BackendContext` runs `checkSupabaseHealth()` (lightweight query to `songs`, 5s timeout). If it succeeds, backend mode is `supabase`; otherwise `local`.
- `songService` and `projectService` wrap every public method in `withFallback(supabaseOp, localOp)`. When mode is already `local`, only the local path runs. When mode is `supabase`, the Supabase path runs first; on throw or error, mode is set to `local`, a `supabase:unavailable` event is fired, and the local path runs. No errors bubble to the UI.
- **ConnectionStatusDialog** appears when in local mode (fixed bottom-right, non-blocking). It shows "Working Offline", optional error details, a "Retry Connection" button (re-runs health check), and "Dismiss". If retry succeeds, the dialog is cleared and data is refreshed from Supabase.

**Auth in local mode:** When `isLocal` is true, `AuthGuard` skips Supabase Auth and renders the app in guest mode so users can use projects offline without logging in. Projects created offline are stored in Dexie only and are not merged with Supabase when reconnecting.

#### 7.2 IndexedDB (Dexie) — local fallback

- **Local storage**: When in fallback mode, all data is stored in the browser (IndexedDB via Dexie).
- **Offline support**: Full functionality without internet when Supabase is not configured or unavailable.
- **Performance**: Fast queries with indexed fields; schema versioned for migrations.

#### 7.3 Database Schema
- **Songs table**: 
  - Indexed on: id, title, artist, type, year, origin, season
  - Compound indexes: [artist+type], [year+season]
  - Stores: id, title, artist, type, origin, season, year, notes
  
- **Song sections table** (song-level sections: part, BPM, key per song):
  - Indexed on: sectionId, songId, bpm, key
  - Compound indexes: [songId+bpm], [songId+key], [songId+sectionOrder]
  - Stores: sectionId, songId, part, bpm, key, sectionOrder
  - One-to-many relationship with songs
  
- **Projects table**:
  - Indexed on: id, name, createdAt, type
  - Stores: id, name, type, createdAt, updatedAt
  
- **Project sections table** (first-class sections per project):
  - Indexed on: id, projectId, orderIndex, [projectId+orderIndex]
  - Stores: id, projectId, name, orderIndex; optional targetBpm, bpmRangeMin, bpmRangeMax, targetKey, keyRangeCamelot, keyRange
  - Editable via **Section Settings** dialog (section name and all harmonic constraints)
  
- **Project entries table**:
  - Indexed on: id, projectId, songId, sectionId, orderIndex; compound [projectId+sectionId+orderIndex]
  - Stores: id, projectId, songId, sectionId, orderIndex, locked, notes
  - References project section via sectionId

The same logical schema is implemented in **Supabase** (PostgreSQL, snake_case columns) and in **Dexie** (camelCase). Services map between DB shapes and the app’s TypeScript types (`Song`, `Project`, `ProjectSection`, `ProjectEntry`, `SongSection`).

#### 7.4 Data Services
- **Song service** (`src/services/songService.ts`): CRUD for songs and song sections. All methods use `withFallback`; Supabase path when mode is `supabase`, Dexie path when `local`. Components call `songService` only; no direct Dexie or Supabase usage.
- **Section service**: CRUD for song sections (used by Dexie path and for orphan cleanup)
  - Get sections by song ID
  - Get unique parts from all sections
  - Section queries with indexed lookups
- **Project service** (`src/services/projectService.ts`): CRUD for projects, **project sections**, and project entries. All methods use `withFallback`; in Supabase mode, `user_id` is set from auth when adding projects.
  - Projects: getAll, getById, add, update, delete
  - Project sections: getSectionsByProject, addSection, updateSection, deleteSection, reorderSections
  - Entries: getEntriesForSection, addSongToSection, removeEntry, reorderEntriesInSection, updateEntryNotes
  - getProjectWithSections: project + sections (with targetBpm/targetKey etc.) + enriched songs per section
- **Search service**: Optimized search queries (in-memory Fuse.js over songs from songService)
- **Export service**: Data export (operates on in-memory project/song data from services)
- **File service**: Import/export with two-file CSV support; CSV load seeds IndexedDB when in local mode and DB is empty

### 12. Section Normalization & Matching

#### 12.1 Section Normalization
- **Hierarchical Section Grouping**: Related section names are normalized to base sections
  - Base sections: Intro, Verse, Prechorus, Chorus, Bridge, Other
  - Examples: "Verse A" → "Verse", "Intro Drop" → "Intro", "Chorus 2" → "Chorus"
  - Enables logical matching between section variations
  
- **Normalization Benefits**:
  - Filter by "Verse" matches "Verse A", "Verse B", "Verse 2", etc.
  - Part-specific filters work with related section names
  - Matching algorithms recognize compatible sections
  - Original section names preserved in database and UI

#### 12.2 Part-Specific Matching Algorithms
- **Section-Level Comparison**: 
  - Matches sections between songs by normalized part names
  - Compares BPM and key at matching section positions
  - Handles songs with different numbers of sections
  
- **Distance-Based Key Scoring**:
  - Uses circular semitone distance for key similarity
  - Accounts for musical key relationships (e.g., C Major vs C# Major)
  - Returns scores from 0.0 (no match) to 1.0 (perfect match)
  
- **Full-Song Key Fallback**:
  - When candidate song only has full-song key (no sections)
  - Compares full-song key against each section in target song
  - Provides compatibility scoring even without section data

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19.1.1**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Framer Motion**: Animations

### Data & Backend
- **Supabase**: Primary backend when configured — PostgreSQL (songs, song_sections, projects, project_sections, project_entries), Auth (user-scoped projects), optional Realtime
- **Dexie 4.2.0**: IndexedDB wrapper used as local fallback when Supabase is unavailable
- **withFallback / BackendContext**: Health check and try-Supabase-then-Dexie pattern; ConnectionStatusDialog for offline mode
- **Fuse.js 7.1.0**: Fuzzy search (in-memory over songs from songService)
- **ExcelJS 4.4.0**: Excel export
- **@dnd-kit**: Drag and drop
- **Lucide React**: Icons

### Testing
- **Vitest**: Unit testing
- **Playwright**: E2E testing
- **Testing Library**: Component testing

## Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**:
   - `BackendContext` runs `checkSupabaseHealth()`. If Supabase responds within 5s, backend mode is `supabase`; otherwise `local`.
   - If Supabase: load songs and projects via `songService` / `projectService` (Supabase path). If local: use IndexedDB; if DB is empty, seed from CSV (songs.csv / song_sections.csv or legacy format), then load from Dexie.
   - Hash-based CSV change detection applies when using local/CSV path.
   - `primaryBpm` and `primaryKey` are computed from sections (e.g. sectionOrder = 1) on demand.

2. **User Actions**:
   - All song/project writes go through `songService` / `projectService`, which use `withFallback`. In Supabase mode, writes hit Supabase; in local mode or after a Supabase error, writes hit IndexedDB. State updates trigger UI refresh.

3. **Mid-session Supabase failure**:
   - If a Supabase call throws, `withFallback` sets mode to `local`, dispatches `supabase:unavailable`, and runs the local op. `BackendContext` listens and updates status; `ConnectionStatusDialog` appears. Subsequent calls use only the local path until the user clicks Retry and the health check succeeds.

4. **Search/Filter**:
   - User input triggers search/filter. Songs come from `songService.getAll()`. Part-specific filters query sections (via service). Results and active filters are maintained in state; filter state is converted to `MatchCriteria` for the matching service.

5. **Matching Process**:
   - Global filters applied to songs first; part-specific filters use section data. Section normalization enables flexible part matching; scores use distance-based algorithms; results sorted by match score.

## Advanced Features

### Section-Based Architecture Benefits
- **Multi-Section Songs**: Properly represent songs with varying BPM/key across sections
- **Section-Level Filtering**: Filter by musical properties at specific song sections
- **Harmonic Transition Analysis**: Foundation for analyzing key/BPM changes within songs
- **AI Scoring Ready**: Architecture supports future section-level similarity scoring
- **Data Integrity**: Normalized structure prevents data inconsistencies

### Quick Match Feature
- **One-Click Matching**: Select a song and instantly find compatible matches
- **Affinity Scoring**: Visual indicators (High/Medium/Low) based on match scores
- **Part-Specific Analysis**: Compares sections between songs for accurate matching
- **Detailed Match Reasons**: Explains why songs match at the section level

### Filter State Management
- **Structured Filter Model**: Enforces mutual exclusivity between filter modes
- **Part-Specific Filter Blocks**: Multiple independent filters for different sections
- **Validation**: Ensures complete filter blocks before application
- **State Persistence**: Filters maintained during session

## Future Considerations

While not currently implemented, the architecture supports:
- Cloud sync capabilities
- User authentication
- Collaborative projects
- Advanced analytics
- Playlist management
- Audio preview integration
- BPM/key detection from audio files
- Section timestamp tracking
- Modulation detection between sections
- AI-based section similarity scoring

**Not yet in the UI (data model or logic exists where noted):**
- **Project year/season**: Not in the Project data model; would require schema and Edit project modal changes.

## Usage Patterns

### Typical Workflow
1. Import songs from CSV or add manually
2. Search/filter to find songs
3. Create projects for specific mixes
4. Add songs to project sections
5. Reorder songs within sections
6. Export projects for reference

### Power User Features
- Advanced matching for harmonic compatibility
- Bulk operations for efficiency
- Custom export formats
- Project templates
- Quick match suggestions

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader considerations
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management
- ARIA labels where appropriate

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with IndexedDB support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile browser support
- Progressive Web App capabilities (optional: vite-plugin-pwa, vite-plugin-compression)

## Routes & Pages

- **`/`** — Main app: library, search, inline filters, Advanced Filters, song list, hero, footer
- **`/projects`** — Projects page: list of projects with Kanban (Seasonal/Year-End/Other) and Megamix timeline (Song Megamix), create/edit/delete projects, open workspace
- **`/projects/:projectId`** — Project workspace: sections, song list per section, drag-and-drop, Section Settings, Suggest Songs drawer, BPM flow, Key graph, Export, Compact mode

---

## Utilities & Extra UI

- **Utility dialog** — Accessible from the main app; provides tools and batch operations (e.g. data/CSV utilities)
- **Vocal phrase index** — Dedicated view for vocal phrase catalog (if enabled)

## Code-Verified Update (May 2026)

The following implementation points are verified against the current codebase and should be treated as authoritative if older sections conflict:

- **Routing and access model**:
  - Routes include `/`, `/projects`, `/projects/:projectId`, `/login`, `/register`, `/auth/callback`, `/account`, `/about`.
  - Auth is enforced in Supabase mode and bypassed in local mode (`ProtectedRoute` / `AuthGuard` behavior).

- **Data architecture**:
  - Active project/song operations run through service-layer fallback (`songService`, `projectService`) with Supabase primary and Dexie fallback.
  - Legacy Node/Express backend exists for songs/import paths but is not the primary project workflow backend.

- **Project model and metadata**:
  - Project type set includes `seasonal`, `year-end`, `song-megamix`, `decade`, `other`.
  - Project metadata supports type-specific fields (e.g., year, season, year-range) plus optional cover image.
  - Section settings UI is implemented and edits target BPM/key and range constraints.

- **Workspace behavior**:
  - In Supabase mode, project workspace edits are staged locally and synced on explicit Save; unsaved-change guard is present.
  - Section and entry workflows include drag reorder, cross-section moves, lock/unlock, per-entry notes, and add-bulk actions.

- **Fuzzy logic integration**:
  - Text fuzzy search (Fuse.js) and compatibility fuzzy scoring (custom matching engine) are separate systems with different scoring semantics.
